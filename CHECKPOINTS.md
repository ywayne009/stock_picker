# Project Checkpoints

This document explains how to work with checkpoints in this project.

## Current Checkpoints

### v0.1-initial-setup (Current)
**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Commit:** 7d8b5ab  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**What's included:**
- Complete project structure (backend + frontend)
- Virtual environment setup
- All dependencies installed
- Docker configuration
- Setup scripts for all platforms
- Documentation (README, QUICKSTART, CLAUDE.md)

**To return to this checkpoint:**
```bash
git checkout v0.1-initial-setup
```

## How to Create New Checkpoints

### 1. Save Your Current Work
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Describe what you implemented"

# Create a tagged checkpoint
git tag -a "v0.2-feature-name" -m "Description of this checkpoint"
```

### 2. List All Checkpoints
```bash
git tag -l
```

### 3. View Checkpoint Details
```bash
git show v0.1-initial-setup
```

## How to Return to a Checkpoint

### Option 1: Just Look Around (Read-only)
```bash
# Checkout the checkpoint
git checkout v0.1-initial-setup

# You're now in "detached HEAD" state - safe to explore
# To return to latest:
git checkout main
```

### Option 2: Create a New Branch from Checkpoint
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch from checkpoint
git checkout -b feature-branch v0.1-initial-setup

# Make changes, then commit
git add -A
git commit -m "New feature"

# Merge back to main when ready
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

### Option 3: Reset to Checkpoint (⚠️ Destructive)
```bash
# WARNING: This will lose any uncommitted changes!
# First, save current work if needed:
git stash

# Reset to checkpoint
git reset --hard v0.1-initial-setup

# To get your stashed changes back:
git stash pop
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Create Checkpoints After Major Milestones
Good times to checkpoint:
- ✅ After completing a major feature
- ✅ Before starting a risky refactor
- ✅ After getting tests to pass
- ✅ At the end of each development session

### 2. Use Descriptive Names
```bash
# Good checkpoint names:
v0.2-database-models
v0.3-strategy-framework
v0.4-backtesting-engine

# Bad checkpoint names:
v0.2-stuff
v0.3-updates
v0.4-fixes
```

### 3. Add Detailed Descriptions
```bash
git tag -a "v0.2-database-models" -m "
Implemented database models:
- Strategy model with versioning
- Backtest results model
- User authentication model
- All migrations created
"
```

### 4. Keep a Checkpoint Log
Update this file each time you create a checkpoint.

## Checkpoint History

| Version | Date | Description | Key Features |
|---------|------|-------------|--------------|
| v0.1-initial-setup | 2025-10-29 | Initial project structure | Backend/frontend setup, dependencies, docs |
| v0.2-??? | TBD | Next milestone | To be added |

## Common Scenarios

### "I broke something, need to go back"
```bash
# See what changed
git diff

# Discard all changes and return to last commit
git reset --hard HEAD

# Or return to specific checkpoint
git reset --hard v0.1-initial-setup
```

### "Want to try something risky"
```bash
# Create a branch from current state
git checkout -b experimental-feature

# Make changes, test
# If it works:
git checkout main
git merge experimental-feature

# If it doesn't work:
git checkout main
git branch -D experimental-feature
```

### "Compare current state with checkpoint"
```bash
# See what files changed
git diff --name-status v0.1-initial-setup

# See detailed changes in a file
git diff v0.1-initial-setup backend/app/main.py
```

## Backup to Remote Repository

### Set up GitHub/GitLab (Optional)
```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/stock_picker.git

# Push all commits and tags
git push -u origin main
git push --tags

# Now your checkpoints are backed up in the cloud!
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Create checkpoint
git add -A && git commit -m "message" && git tag -a "v0.X-name" -m "description"

# List checkpoints
git tag -l

# Go to checkpoint
git checkout v0.X-name

# Return to latest
git checkout main

# Compare with checkpoint
git diff v0.X-name
```

**Remember:** Checkpoints are your safety net. Create them frequently!
