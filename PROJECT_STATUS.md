# Project Status & Session Handoff

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29  
**Current Version:** v0.1-initial-setup  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Initial setup complete, ready for development

---

## üìç Current State

‚úÖ **Project Structure (100% Complete)**
- Backend structure with FastAPI framework
- Frontend structure with Next.js/React
- Database configuration (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB)
- Redis caching setup
- Docker configuration (full and services-only)

‚úÖ **Development Environment (100% Complete)**
- Python virtual environment created (`backend/venv/`)
- All Python dependencies installed (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, OpenAI, etc.)
- Node.js dependencies installed (Next.js, React, TypeScript)
- Setup scripts for Unix/Mac and Windows

‚úÖ **Version Control (100% Complete)**
- Git repository initialized
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/ywayne009/stock_picker
- Checkpoint: v0.1-initial-setup
- SSH authentication configured

‚úÖ **Documentation (100% Complete)**
- README.md - Full project documentation
- QUICKSTART.md - 5-minute setup guide
- CLAUDE.md - Development guidelines for Claude Code
- CHECKPOINTS.md - Checkpoint management guide
- GIT_WORKFLOW.md - Git workflow reference
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture overview

### What's NOT Complete (Placeholder Files Only)

‚ùå **Core Implementation (0% Complete)**
- All Python files are placeholders with structure only
- No actual business logic implemented yet
- Database models not defined
- API endpoints not implemented
- Frontend components are empty shells

### Known Issues

‚ö†Ô∏è **Technical Indicators Libraries**
- `ta-lib` and `pandas-ta` are commented out in requirements.txt
- Reason: ta-lib requires C library installation
- Solution: Either install ta-lib system library or implement indicators with pandas
- Location: `backend/requirements.txt` lines 18-20

‚ö†Ô∏è **Python Version**
- Current: Python 3.9
- Recommended: Python 3.11+
- Impact: Some newer package features unavailable
- Not blocking development

‚ö†Ô∏è **Database Services**
- Docker not installed on development machine
- PostgreSQL and Redis need to be installed locally or Docker installed
- Current workaround: Can develop backend without DB initially

---

## üéØ What to Work on Next

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Set Up Database Services**
   - Install Docker OR install PostgreSQL/Redis locally
   - Test database connection
   - Location: See `docker-compose.services.yml` or local install instructions

2. **Implement Database Models**
   - Define Strategy model with versioning
   - Define Backtest model
   - Define User model (optional for now)
   - Location: `backend/app/models/`
   - Reference: See CLAUDE.md for schema details

3. **Create Database Migrations**
   - Set up Alembic configuration
   - Generate initial migration
   - Location: `backend/alembic/`

4. **Implement First API Endpoint**
   - Start with health check (already exists)
   - Add strategy CRUD endpoints
   - Location: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/strategies.py`

5. **Implement Base Strategy Class**
   - Complete the Strategy base class implementation
   - Add example strategy (e.g., Moving Average Crossover)
   - Location: `backend/app/services/strategy/base_strategy.py`

### Future Milestones

- [ ] Data acquisition module (Polygon.io, Alpaca integration)
- [ ] Backtesting engine implementation
- [ ] AI strategy generation (OpenAI integration)
- [ ] Frontend components and pages
- [ ] Testing suite
- [ ] Deployment configuration

## üîß Development Environment

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/wayne/main/labs/stock_picker

# Get latest from GitHub
git pull

# Activate backend virtual environment
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# Start backend (when ready)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Start frontend (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables Needed

Located in `.env` file (already created):
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI strategy generation (not needed yet)
- `POLYGON_API_KEY` or `ALPACA_API_KEY` - For market data (not needed yet)
- Database connection strings (when DB is set up)

- Config: `backend/app/core/config.py`
- Database: `backend/app/core/database.py`

### Service Modules (All Placeholder)
- Strategies: `backend/app/services/strategy/`
- Backtesting: `backend/app/services/backtest/`
- AI Generation: `backend/app/services/ai/`
- Data Providers: `backend/app/services/data/`

### Frontend Entry Points

## üí° Context for Claude Code

### When Starting a New Session

**What Claude should know:**
1. This is a **greenfield project** - structure exists but implementation is minimal
2. The architecture follows the plan in `stock_picking_tool_development_plan0.md`
3. Code style: Follow patterns in CLAUDE.md
4. All dependencies are already installed
5. Git repo is connected to GitHub

**How to orient yourself:**
1. Read this file (PROJECT_STATUS.md) first
2. Check CLAUDE.md for architecture and patterns
3. Look at the development plan: `stock_picking_tool_development_plan0.md`
4. Check git status: `git status` and `git log --oneline`
5. Review what files exist: `find backend/app -name "*.py" -type f`

**Before starting work:**
1. Confirm with user which feature to implement
2. Check if database services are running (if needed)
3. Ensure virtual environment is activated
4. Run a quick test: `python -c "import fastapi; print('Ready!')"`

### Important Architectural Decisions Made

1. **Strategy Pattern**: All trading strategies inherit from `Strategy` base class
2. **Repository Pattern**: Strategies stored in PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexibility
3. **Virtual Environment**: Using venv (not conda or poetry)
4. **Docker Hybrid**: Services in Docker, code runs locally
5. **Testing**: pytest for backend, will use Jest for frontend
6. **API Style**: RESTful with FastAPI, OpenAPI docs at /docs

### Code Conventions to Follow

- Python: Follow PEP 8, use type hints
- Imports: Absolute imports from `app.`
- Docstrings: Google style
- API endpoints: Version prefix `/api/v1/`
- Error handling: Use FastAPI HTTPException
- Config: All config in `app/core/config.py` via environment variables
